  The Network Addon Mod will introduce numerous network and traffic enhancements to the game.

-Run Cleanitol and the Station Updater
  Run the Cleanitol program, which removes all plugins incompatible with the NAM from your system.
  This is automatically done at a NAM upgrade, and usually doesn't have to be done otherwise.

+Traffic Driving Side (Usually shouldn't be changed)
  The traffic driving side is usually set automatically, but can be changed here if necessary.
  -Game traffic drives on right side of road
    Choose this option only if your traffic drives on the right side of the road in the game.
  -Game traffic drives on left side of road
    Choose this option only if your traffic drives on the left side of the road in the game.

  Includes options for the NAM Traffic Simulator, the Automata Controller, and the new Zones Data View.
